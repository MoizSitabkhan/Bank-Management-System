# Bank-Management-System
All the functionalities of a bank in C 

### This is the Project I created in C while learning Data Structures in C language and getting familiar with them that performs all the functionalities a basic bank could perfrom like:
1. Create a bank account
2. View Balance
3. Deposit Money
4. Withdraw Money 
5. Rate our bank
6. Complains or feedback 
7. Option if you forgot password

### A password is also added when creating a new account
### It would ask for password when asking to check for a particular account and only the right user to withdraw or deposit money
